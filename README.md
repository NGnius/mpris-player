# mpris-player (WIP!)
#### A Rust library for creating MPRIS2 media players over D-Bus


## What is MPRIS?
The Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification is a standard D-Bus interface which aims to provide a common programmatic API for controlling media players.

It provides a mechanism for discovery, querying and basic playback control of compliant media players, as well as a tracklist interface which is used to add context to the active media item.
